# **App Name**: Property Pal

## Core Features:

- Property Listing: Displays a list of properties, with image, price, address and bed/bath details from hardcoded data.
- Favorite Button: Add a button to each listing. Toggle properties as 'favorite' and store IDs in localStorage.
- Persistent Storage: Load and save favorite property IDs using the browser's localStorage API.
- Favorite Filtering: Display the favorite properties of a user in a view when prompted via an 'Show Favorites' control.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#7EC4CF) to create a sense of trust and tranquility, evoking feelings of stability.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8F8F9), almost white, offering a clean and calm backdrop.
- Accent color: Muted green (#98D7A5) to highlight important interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a versatile, humanist sans-serif for a modern and slightly warm aesthetic.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for property details (bed, bath) and the favorite button, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
- Implement a clean, card-based layout for property listings. Cards should be visually distinct and easy to scan.
- Use a subtle transition effect when toggling favorite status, like a gentle fade or scaling of the heart icon.
